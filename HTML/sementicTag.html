        <h1>chicken</h1>
        <p>Chickens are average-sized fowls, characterized by smaller heads, short beaks and wings, and a round body perched on featherless legs. Exact size varies greatly among breeds, as does color. In many breeds, both sexes will have fleshy skin folds on the chin and atop the head, known as wattles and combs, respectively.
            Chickens are relatively large birds, active by day. The body is round, the legs are unfeathered in most breeds, and the wings are short.
